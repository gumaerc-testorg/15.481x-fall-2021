  "course_description": "Economists can\u2019t agree on whether investors and markets are rational and efficient, as modern financial theory assumes, or irrational and inefficient, as behavioral economists believe. In this course, MIT finance professor Andrew W. Lo cuts through this debate with a new framework\u2014the Adaptive Markets Hypothesis\u2014in which rationality and irrationality coexist.\u00a0\n\nDrawing on psychology, evolutionary biology, neuroscience, artificial intelligence, and other fields, this course shows that the theory of market efficiency isn\u2019t wrong, but merely incomplete.\n\nTopics:\n\n- Unit 1: Introduction and Financial Orthodoxy\n- Unit 2: Rejecting the Random Walk and Efficient Markets\n- Unit 3: Behavioral Biases and Psychology\n- Unit 4: The Neuroscience of Decision-Making\n- Unit 5: Evolution and the Origin of Behavior\n- Unit 6: The Adaptive Markets Hypothesis\n- Unit: 7: Hedge Funds: The Galapagos Islands of Finance\n- Unit 8: Applications of Adaptive Markets\n- Unit 9: The Financial Crisis\n- Unit 10: Ethics and Adaptive Markets\n- Unit 11: The Finance of the Future and the Future of Finance\n\nAs part of the [Open Learning Library (OLL)](https://openlearninglibrary.mit.edu/), this course is free to use.
